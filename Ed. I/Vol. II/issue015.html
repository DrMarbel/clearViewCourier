            <h3>Today's View: Climactic Transformation Trope</h3>
            <p>It's no secret to anime and manga fans across the world that transformations are exciting. The same could even be said for transformations during movies, TV shows, and stories. However, I'm going to be talking about a recent transformation of a character that has seen the big screen here in the U.S.; an infamous pirate wanted by the World Government which sails aboard the Thousand Sunny: Monkey D. Luffy. As a long term fan of the show, One Piece, myself, I also got excited when I learned of Luffy's newest powerup. This ability- which he calls "5th Gear"/"Gear 5th" (Eng/Jpn)- is the awakened form of the Nika Nika fruit, and it bestows it's user a rubber-like body.</p>
            <p>If you've never watched the show or read the manga, you'll likely not know what I'm talking about. If that's the case, you could associate a transformation like this with the excitement one feels whenever their favorite character in a show or movie comes back even stronger or in some really epic way.</p>
            <p>This is a popular trope for characters to wind up adopting. While Luffy's transformation was physical, not all transformations are as such. Some involve an item that makes their character stronger, others involve the acquisition of some sort of knowledge, and some even involve personal growth. For example, if you've watched Power Rangers, Transformers, or even The Lord of the Rings. What's more, it isn't hard to spot them, if you know what you're looking for.</p>
            <p>No matter where you've seen them, you can think of characters that seem stupidly cool by the end of their stories. If pulled off well enough, you'll inspire a lot of confidence and excitement for anything involving that character in the future. However, this trope isn't an easy one to handle properly. It can be awkward and entirely hit or miss. So, if you're a writer trying to use this trope, be careful. This can make or break your characters.</p>
            <p>I do believe that the trope can be extremely effective, though. While I don't think all characters should utilize this mode of storytelling, I do think that a majority of them can benefit from it. What's more, as I said, it doesn't have to be a physical transformation. It could be mental, emotional, or even just character growth.</p>
