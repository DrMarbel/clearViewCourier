                <p>I've worked in customer service for a few years now, and I've noticed some universal truths about them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers don't truly know what's going on</li>
                    <li>Customers can't guarantee they won't waste your time</li>
                    <li>Customers can't read</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No matter what you say- or do- customers won't know why something doesn't work as they believe it should. I had several customers, across several consecutive weeks, ask about sales and why something didn't match their expected price. Each time, it was the same situation: 3 for $15 sales on both Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper products not mixing.</p>
                <p>The establishment I currently work for features new sales each week, with some notable exceptions. Soda is one of those exceptions. There is always a sale on soda. However, despite our tags saying:
                    <blockquote>3 for $15 on Dr. Pepper, Sunkist, and Canada Dry</blockquote>
                the customer will always grab a Coke product, too.
                </p>
                <p>Typically, that's fine- until you tell them the price. Tell them their total is $17.95 and they blink at you while complaining about how the soda is supposed to be on sale. You could even tell them that Coke and Dr. Pepper are not the same company.</p>
                <p>Now, I've explained to people in my area that the business that distributes Coke products in my area had made a deal with the Dr. Pepper Bottling Company to also handle their distributions. <b>That phases them not and still they persist.</b> The situation usually involves me overriding the price and selling the soda for cheaper than it should be.</p>

                <br>

                <p>In another instance, the same can be said about chips. Frito-Lay is a regular vendor in my store, as they are in many other stores. However, we manage the sales that go on for their products.</p>
                <p>I recently had a customer that bought Sunchips, Cheetos, and Fritos, claiming that they were all part of a 3 for $6 sale. Since I wasn't doing much at the time, and my cashier was helping the individuals I'm talking about, I decided to go and check their tag on the shelf to make sure their chips ring up at the proper price. Sure enough, they didn't and the customers weren't thrilled at the prospect of paying more.</p>
                <p>When asked about why the sale didn't apply, I explained to them the details of what I had read from the tag:
                    <blockquote>"3 for $6 on select Frito-Lay products: Sunchips, Cheetos, and Smartfoods Popcorn"</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>They politely disagreed, stating Fritos were a part of the sale. I asked them to follow me to the tag to double check the wording of the sale. To their dismay, they had misread the label and inserted Fritos on their own.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Usually, customers give me such a headache when they don't pay attention, but I believe it gives the employees who work in stores even more of a headache when they call you over to assist them, only to find out that the Self-Checkout machine they are at isn't actually broken- but waiting on them to take a bill it spat out due to it's wrinkles or tears.</p>
                <p>It amazes me sometimes how far people will go to ask for help when they can help themselves most of the time. That being said, customer service requires people like me to serve the customer. That, my friends, is job security.</p>

            <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Even though customers give employees headaches, the employees can take solace in one fact that I've recently come to be aware of: customer service is good stewardship. Take heart in that, and try to be nice to them. Most of the time, customers mean well.</p>
