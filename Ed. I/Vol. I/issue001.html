  <h3><b><u>Today’s Musing: Job Applications</u></b></h3>

  <p>Ever noticed how companies are hiring but they won’t hire you? That’s quite a common occurrence among several individuals I know of. Many people who are starting off in the workforce hit online job boards and look for something that might be entry-level in their field of study or preference, only to find out that all of the entry-level listings require something like 2-10 years of working experience and have a stupidly long list of qualifications that look absolutely terrifying to the untrained individual.</p>

  <p>Allow me to pause for a moment and welcome you to Marbel Musings. I’m the creator of this endeavor, Dr. Marbel. Over the course of this project, I will provide you with content to peruse at your leisure. Keep in mind, this isn’t to be funny or to provide any sort of news. The point is to provide some insight into day-to-day issues I experience and come across. However, that is subject to change as this periodical grows and evolves. That said, please enjoy today’s musing!</p>

  <p>I’ve not had a lot of experience with this subject, but I do know what others around me who weren’t as fortunate at getting a job right away went through. According to what they’ve told me, what you see on those listings are preferences, despite saying they’re requirements. It’s ideal to be able to honestly say you have some of what they ask for, but you could get by with no experience at all. It’s extremely rare, but I’ve heard of it happening.</p>

  <p>One thing that I’ve been told that stands out to me is to apply for anything and everything in the field, even if you think you probably won’t get it. That same person also provided this quote:</p>

  <blockquote>“Applying for jobs takes forever and a lot of trying again and again. Lots of people put in 30+ applications (I submitted 50+) before they hear back from anyone, let alone get a job offer. However, a lot of jobs will hire people who don't meet everything from the job listing, which is nice but sucks while looking. Apply for anything and everything if it looks decent.” (Anonymous)</blockquote>

  <p>The process takes a lot of time, but with diligence, you can find the job you want. That said, there are ways to get noticed easier by your prospective employer:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Provide a cover letter, if you can</li>
    <li>Emphasize related soft skills</li>
    <li>Make your name the first and biggest thing your employer will see on your resume</li>
    <li>Keep your resume concise</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition, you don’t want a stupendously long resume. On average, employers will look at resumes for 10 seconds before putting it down so your resume needs to stand out from the rest. There are plenty of resources for resume building on the internet, but check out Indeed for expert-level advice on resume crafting.</p>

  <p>This periodical isn’t perfect, but it’s the start of a journey I believe you might enjoy. The format will likely change as time goes on, but I intend to talk about topics I enjoy or feel is important. Hopefully, you’ll stick around with me and enjoy what I bring to you.</p>
