                <p>It's officially been declared spring and people are already flocking to their yards to prepare for the oncoming agricultural season. Farmers are tilling up their fields and sowing their seeds. However, a different group of people are also prepping their yards for the agricultural season: gardeners. I, too, have taken to the great outdoors which lies beyond the grand entryway that I call my porch. I like to think that I have myself a green thumb, but I know that there are things I do not have the proper dilligence or skillset to cultivate. That said, I have a bit of advice that I can share from personal experience to assist you in your garden work, should you decide to keep a garden this year.</p>
                <p>The first thing you should do is take note of the trees in your area. Believe it or not, they do determine what plants are compatible with your local soil. Once you identify the trees closest to your garden, figure out if they make the soil more acidic or basic. For example, Pine trees make the soil more acidic. Hardy plants like Jonquils, Flagstaffs, Hostas, and other greeneries work well in these conditions. Delicate plants like Bleeding Hearts, Forget-Me-Nots, and Lupines typically like more basic and neutral soils. Yes, gardening is not just putting plants in the ground. It is a bit of a niche part of agricultural and horticultural science.</p>
                <p>Some of you might know what I mean by acidic, neautral, and basic soil. I'm referring to a basic chemistry measurment: pH levels. They have a lot to do with your gardens, but you don't have to go out and buy litmus tests to test your soil. As I said before, you can look up if your tree makes your soil acidic or basic. The next question people will be asking is how to neutralize soil pH levels to ensure growth of a wide variety of plants and trees. The answer to that is two fold:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your soil is <u>acidic</u>, sow powdered limestone in the place you're trying to plant something</li>
                        <li>If you soil is <u>basic</u>, sow compost in the place you're trying to plant something</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Managing pH levels will go a long way to keeping your plants healthy and happy, but there are a few other factors to consider still. One such factor is the heat and sunlight levels in the intended planting area. If you plant a delicate plant, such as English Ivy, it will burn in direct sunlight when exposed to it for long periods of time. Pay attention to where plants are kept while buying them and do your own research into where to place plants.</p>
                <p>In the end, it all boils down to just researching what keeps the plant healthy and happy. As long as you know what plant you're dealing with, you can google it and figure out where it likes to be, how much sun it needs, how much water, etc.</p>

                <p>I heard through the musing line something having to do with college and work. One of my readers told me of difficulties in college for her, while the rest of her class didn't seem to have those same difficulties. One day, a classmate of hers asked her a question about an assignment and she found out she was in the same boat as my reader. My reader was happy to include that, despite her grades not improving, her self-esteem improved along with her overall mental health. She talked with some other classmates and found out that they were all in that same predicament. Acknowledging these things can be beneficial for you, and others around you. However, it's important to remember that this can be applied to the work place.</p>
                <p>Her advice: try forming a community or outlet to discuss the struggle and related issues.</p>

                <p>I encountered a Gossip Stone again yesterday evening, just before I was going inside for the night. After realizing it was the same one as the first one I'd met, I named it Gozzip. It told me the following:
                    <blockquote style="color: darkcyan;">"Boing-oing! I overheard a conversation over fuel types. Did you know that there are engines being made to burn hydrogen capsules? Supposedly, it's more efficient than electricity and more powerful than gasoline."</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>I went online after Gozzip vanished beneath the ground and googled it. Hydrogen engines are an experimental engine type that utilize hydrogen fuel cells. These fuel cells are filled with natural gas that's been refined down to hydrogen. Companies like ExxonMobil are leading the charge to produce the fuel that future low-carbon engines require. Now that's going green.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Closing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Gardening can be truly rewarding for those who simply wish to keep things alive and healthy. Not only can you learn valuable skills, but it can actually assist you with learning patience and routine-building. Get in touch with nature, or if you don't want to go outside, bring it indoors with a patch of grass. At least, that way, you can say you touched grass on any given day.</p>
