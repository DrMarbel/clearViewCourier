            <h3>The Story: BASIC knowledge</h3>
            <p>Thank you for joining us as we transition from Volume II to Volume III. Today, I have something that might pique your interest. Computers have become ubiquitous since their public release in the 1980s, finding their way into homes and pockets alike. Initially serving as tools for both work and home offices, they quickly became indispensable.</p>

            <p>However, it wasn't long before individuals began developing custom software, ranging from games to complex business applications, predominantly written in BASIC. While remnants of this language persist in modern counterparts like VisualBASIC, BASIC itself recently turned 60 years old. Remarkably, it gave rise to much of what we know in the modern era.</p>

            <p>Basic's humble origins played a pivotal role in democratizing programming, empowering individuals from diverse backgrounds to utilize computing power. Initially conceived as a teaching tool, its simplicity made it accessible to beginners, yet its versatility allowed for a wide range of applications, from text-based adventures to intricate business software.</p>

            <p>Despite criticisms of its syntax, BASIC fostered creativity and experimentation, leaving an indelible mark on the programming landscape. Modern iterations like Visual Basic and VBScript continue to carry on its legacy, offering developers familiar tools for rapid application development.</p>

            <p>But perhaps BASIC's greatest legacy lies in its role as a stepping stone for aspiring programmers, sparking a lifelong passion for technology and innovation. As we reflect on BASIC's 60-year journey, let's remember its profound contributions to the world of computing and celebrate the countless minds it has inspired along the way.</p>

            <p>I was looking around my home yesterday and just doing some general cleaning when I hear this strange noise on my phone. It made this crazy buzzing noise only to be followed by the noise of three, progressively louder beeps. Finally, by the time I got over to my phone, Gozzip appeared and told me the following:
                <blockquote class="gozzip_quote">"I've returned to give you the answers to Monday's riddle set. Here they are:

            <h3>Goblin Gourmet: Unconventional Recipes from the Undergrowth</h3>
            <p>Hello, all dear readers, my name is Gleebgloob and today I am going to share with you a recipe that will be an easy and fast meal for anyone to make at home. This was a dish I learned back in my old goblin pack from my mother, before I went on my culinary journey through the world to end up here. This is a good quick dish that can be paired with many main dishes or stand alone. To make it even better all ingredients can be gotten at the mart of Wal.</p>
            <p>I will be telling it like I learned it but will provide secondary options to swap for those who do not live in a cave or deep underground.</p>
            <p>Gunta ta yan degalis, but the translation is Mushroom and leek pasta.</p>
            <p><b><u>To begin you will need:</u></b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>8 oz raja gunta (substitute sliced mushroom, The small portabellas will work.)</li>
                <li>1 laga yan  (substitute 1 leek. Washed chunked into quarters.)</li>
                <li>Degalis  (pasta of choice, I recommended linguine)</li>
                <li>Cran toil (substitute for some oregano)</li>
                <li>Muck ala (sub in heavy cream)</li>
                <li>Rena junta (a clove of garlic finely chopped)</li>
                <li>2 cups dela un thegent (chicken or vegetable broth if you want to make it vegetarian)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For the purpose of convenience, I will be doing the instructions with the substitutions as most who will read this will get their ingredients from above ground.</p>
            <p>To begin, place your pot of water to boil for the pasta on the fire so it can warm up while working. Then slice the leek long ways splitting in half then into four strips. Take to sink and rinse thoroughly to get all dirt out of the layers.</p>
            <p>Then take and cut across to make quartered, set aside.</p>
            <p>Place a pan or skillet on a fire, if stove top on medium low heat. Drizzle some oil in the pan. Once the oil is hot place in the mushrooms and let them cook for a bit. Then add in the garlic and cook until fragrant.  Once garlic is fragrant add in the leek and let cook to soften.</p>
            <p>Add in the broth and bring to a boil. Let boil few three minutes then turn down to simmer and add the herbs and cream. Let simmer.</p>
            <p>Somewhere in that process above your water will boil for the pasta, so add in the pasta and remove from water before completely cooked. I believe that technique is from a man named Al Dente. This is because we will add the pasta to finish cooking into the sauce we have made.</p>
            <p>Once the pasta has finished cooking in the sauce, find your favorite bowl and serve up some for a tasty dish. Remember to find the delights in the world and you will find your way out of the darkness.</p>

            <h3>Cremarian Intruigue</h3>
            <h5><i>Episode IV</i></h5>
            <p><i>Last time, tensions ran high as Calta proposed to pick the lock when Serana confronted her about the situation she has suddenly found herself in, demanding answers to why the mayor of Borden wishes to execute her.</i></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Serana: (frustrated) No, I want answers! Why am I being hunted like some common criminal? Everyone knows me here! It's not like I did any damage to the townsfolk! I just stole some food from the Inn!</p>
                <p>Calta: (sighing) Serana, please. We don't have time for this; we need to move.</p>
                <p>Serana: (exasperated) Fine! You need to cough up those answers once we're out of here, though! And where do you intend to take us once we're out?</p>
                <p>Calta: (sighing) I plan on taking us south; into the badlands where I was caught. I have something of a hideout there that we can use for a couple days.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Calta works on picking the lock while Serana paces tirelessly. Eventually, a click is heard and the cell door squeals open.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Guard III: (agitated, walking into the cell block) What's going on back there? All your yelling and nonsense is really getting on my nerves!</p>
                <p>Calta: Serana, now! Make a dash for it!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As the guard approaches Calta and Serana's shared cell, Calta slams the door against the guard. Serana makes a dash for the entrance of the jail only to be surprised by the other two guards who had brought her in earlier. She confidently weaves through them and manages to slip away, abandoning Calta within the jail.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Serana: (yelling) Good luck, Calta! Thanks for getting me out!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><i>I can't take a risk on getting caught again here. Buren is after me, and so is the mayor so I have to leave home. Calta mentioned a hideout to the south, but screw that. I'm not going into those Orc infested lands! I will head north and find a new town to live in. Perhaps I'll go to Vanport...</i></p>
            <p><i>Betrayal! Serana has abandoned Calta in the Borden Jail and used her to escape. Will Calta escape as well, or will Calta be executed for allowing Serana to escape? As Serana travels northward, the story continues.</i></p>
