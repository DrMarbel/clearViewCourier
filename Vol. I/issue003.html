                <p>Has anyone taken notice of the darker side of YouTube? It's a mildly scary place, if you ask me. To travel there, all you have to do is type in something along the lines of your kid's favorite character's name in YouTube Kids. You might not find them right off, but you'll see them eventually if you let AutoPlay take you for a ride.</p>

                <p>Parents, aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters, take heed of these words: do not leave a child alone with YouTube Kids. The things a child might be exposed to is truly unsettling. Graphic scenes ranging from infedelity to random pregnancies to sugar-coated violence. These videos feature things similar to what actual kids cartoons present, but to a much more crude degree. The creators of these content farms will use stolen or poorly created assets that resemble other more successful properties.</p>

                <p>Characters like Spiderman, Elsa, Mickey & Minnie Mouse, Pomni, Five Nights at Freddy's characters, Poppy Playtime characters, and more are subject to situations that are definitely not child-friendly. Even talking about it like this is horrendous and highly uncomfortable. It doesn't matter where these characters come from: if it's popular, it's got a content farm. Now, I've talked about what to expect with these videos, and what properties are used, but here is what they aim to accomplish:
                    <blockquote>"They aren't here to create anything genuine or new, or bold, or imaginative; they are here to upload, upload, upload, upload." (Saberspark, "<i>YouTube Content Farms Are Getting WORSE...</i>")</blockquote>
                </p>

                <p>Several YouTubers- such as <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/@Saberspark">Saberspark</a>, <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/@augusttheduck">AugustTheDuck</a>, <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/@ConnerTheWaffle">ConnorTheWaffle</a>, and <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/@KeidBoi">KeidBoi</a>- have already stepped up long before the writing of this musing. It isn't hard to find out their viewpoints on these content theives. All you have to do is just look up "Content Farm Channels" and you'll be met with a number of YouTubers, with large and small viewerships, speaking out about how these farms need to be stopped.</p>

                <p>I think that it's even worse that YouTube as a platform <i><b><u>rewards</u></b></i> these channels for their rapid uploads and the views they get from literal children on the internet. They rake in millions of views and make money off of it. Lots of money, in fact. Think thousands of US dollars, and it's only getting worse. So, do us all a favor: if you find one of these content farms, report it.</p>

                <p>As a last comment on the issue, look for these channels at your own risk. The content they post does not align with what children should be exposed to, I'm sure we can agree.</p>

                <p>I heard through the musing line of some dissent over the American academic grading system. She tells me of how annoying it is that american children and adults are forced into a system in which they are assigned an arbitrary value based on their work they have turned in. It doesn't matter if you're in college, high school, or elementary school, you're familiar with what an "A" and what an "F" means.</p>
                <p>It probably isn't common knowledge, but allow me to present the following to you: an American "F" is typically a "C" equivalent in other countries. Take note of Japan, for example, where this is the case: a 50% here in the States is an "F" or failing grade while a 50% in Japan, Ireland, England, and other countries is an average grade or "C" equivalent.</p>
                <p>Some of you might be curious about what makes the US different from other countries. Here is part of the answer: Americans are held to a much higher standard of excellence and our grading system reflects comprehensive mastery of any given class.</p>

                <p>A Gossip Stone appeared in my yard yesterday. Confused, I walked up to it and stared at it for a good while before it finally spoke to me with a "boing-oing". It relayed to me that it will tell me, from here on, about what it overhears from others walking past it in the wild. Here is what it told me yesterday:
                    <blockquote>"Boing-oing! I overheard a conversation about favorite flowers. They talked about Carnations and Roses. Did you know that the Rose is the flower people are supposed to give out on Father's Day?"</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>After doing some reasearch on that, I learned that a red rose symbolizes a living father, while a white rose symbolizes a deceased one. Additionally, carnations are what peoples are supposed to wear or give on Mother's Day. That is a tradition that goes back to the origins of Mother's Day. Interestingly, in the popular Nintendo Switch title "<i>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</i>", a the player's father sends them a red rose on Father's Day in the in-game calendar.</p>

            <p>This YouTuber talks about a wide variety of things, but he's mostly known for his animation and film critiques. He's created documentaries on animation studios that have kept me watching since the early days of his channel. In fact, he's the one that got me started on looking into the fiasco that is content farms, being one of the larger voices to speak out against content farming. Check out his YouTube channel, give him some likes and <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/@Saberspark">subscribe</a>!</p>
