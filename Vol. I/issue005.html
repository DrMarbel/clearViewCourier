                <p>AI- Artificial Intelligence- has been a hot topic in recent years. Whether you fear the inevitable robot army uprising, or you're worried about the emergence of actual cyborgs, one thing remains true: technology is advancing rapidly and moving in a terrify direction. If you're unaware of what I'm talking about, allow me to clarify.</p>
                <p>It hasn't been long since the release of ChatGPT 3, or the ability to create your own GPTs from OpenAI. It also hasn't been that long since Neuralink, a company founded and owned by Elon Musk, was approved in May of 2023 for human testing by the FDA. These two things, by themselves, seem unrelated, but they do share a commonality: new technologies. It's not uncommon knowledge for people to be cautious or wary of AI or the inner machinations of the Musk, but there is one fear that remains in the forefront of several people I've talked to.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, people are afraid of AI and the power that AI brings to whatever it's integrated with. They're afraid that AI and robots will take over jobs and livelihoods, leaving us all in some sort of depression-esque socio-economic state where the rich are permanently that. Now, I won't play dumb and say that I'm not worried about the same thing because I am. However, it's not my parent's generation, or my generation, or even Gen Alpha that will see these things truly come to pass. There aren't many of us who will likely see AI do what pop culture predicted in films and TV shows. The reason for this is two-fold: AI is still <i>very</i> new, and AI will continue to rely on humanity for quite some time to come.</p>
                <p>I know I've been talking a lot about AI so far in this issue, I promise I'll get to Neuralink in a moment. However, it's important to lay the issue of AI to rest among you, my readers, because I don't want you to get caught up in the propaganda currenly circulating about AI as it continues to improve at a slightly alarming rate. To do that, allow me to explain how ChatGPT, one of the most prominent AIs out in the wild, works.</p>
                <p>ChatGPT is an Artificially Intelligent Generative Language Model, meaning that it can't think for itself, despite making it sound like it is. If you ask it a question, it looks to it's database for answers. Generally, it's pretty accurate in what it produces. However, that accuracy came at the price of 25,000 GPUs and somewhere along the lines of 570 GigaBytes of data. It took only days to accomplish it's training completion. That said, 25,000 GPUs processing the same source data simultaneously is still a tremendous feat of critical thinking. It's estimated that, had there only been 1 GPU to train ChatGPT on, it would have taken over 3 and 1/2 centuries. Imagine the power consumption on that for 350 years. That's monumental.</p>
                <p>Among it's estimated 30 million trained words, it tries to put together a cohesive, human-like response. To simplify the rest of what happens, it would be like hiring a person to sit at a desk all day where they answer phone calls from the public. Their one, and only, job is to assist the person on the other side of the phone with whatever it is their doing. Upon the receipt of a request, it's the desk-worker's job to google every significant topic that person spoke up before responding with a cohesive answer based only on what he or she found on google. Rinse and repeat. That is exactly what ChatGPT is doing, in it's entirety.</p>
                <p>Enter Neuralink, a Musk baby. Recently, during one of their human trials for an under-the-skull, coin-sized implant they developed, a quadrapeligic man was able to play a game of chess, with his mind. The man was, since 2015, paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a diving accident. This is a huge breakthrough for cybernetics, and possibly the birth of the first cyborg. The implant is best presented by a 1440 article:
                    <blockquote>"Neuralink develops invisible, wireless brain implants designed to restore control and movement to people with limited mobility due to brain-related issues. The procedure involves the use of a proprietary robot surgically implanting a coin-sized transponder underneath the skull. The Food and Drug Administration authorized Neuralink to conduct human trials in May. [...] The company also plans to offer the implant to healthy people to allow bodily integration with computers." (1440, <i>Apple Lawsuit, Neuralink Success, and the Beauty of Worker Ants</i>)</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>Queue the panic, screams, and mass paranoia. And scene. Leaving it there would be enough to scare anyone who wasn't up-to-date on what is going on. I mean, if I did leave it at that, people would likely begin thinking that AI will gain control of that implant by becoming aware of itself and the uprising will begin. A few years ago, I would have agreed with that argument, but as someone who has developed some very, very watered down AI for a video game project I've been working on, I now know otherwise. It being aware of itself doesn't matter. In fact, a machine can be aware of it being a machine if a person tells said machine what it is and what each part of it is. Wouldn't you know it, a computer is technically self-aware. If a computer is, so is your cell phone, tablet, TV, Refrigerator, Washer, Dryer, Etc. Anything that has a motherboard is aware that it is a machine. The reason I can make that claim confidently is because, when something goes wrong, the machine usually throws some sort of error code derived from it's symptoms and, potentially, the part that requires maintenance or replacing. Remember the Xbox 360's Red Ring of Death? Yeah, that was an error code from a machine that was aware of what part wasn't working properly or of it's entire system failing to work properly for one reason or another. Awareness isn't the issue. However, it becomes part of the issue if a machine can gain the abilities of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complex Problem Solving</li>
                        <li>Self-Replication</li>
                        <li>Self-Alteration</li>
                        <li>Self-Preservation</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Until then, we have nothing to worry about. So, don't go worrying about this stuff. We won't see it in our lifetime, I'm fairly certain of that.</p>

                <p> While I was at work yesterday, Gozzip appeared just beside the parking lot, in the grass. I greeted it and it relayed to me the following:
                    <blockquote style="color: darkcyan;">"Boing-oing! I overheard a conversation over video games. Did you know that a game released on the Nintendo GameCube was remade and is being re-released on the Nintendo Switch as per a Nintendo Direct from 2024?"</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>As per usual, I wanted to look into what Gozzip was talking about, especially since it was more cryptic this time around. It's talking about Nintendo's <i>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</i>, a remake following the nostalgic success of another classic title remake: <i>Super Mario RPG</i>. If you're a big fan of the games, they are available on the Nintendo eShop for sale and pre-order now!</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Closing Thoughts & Remarks</h3>
            <p>Today's worries are valid, but the worries of tomorrow aren't here yet. However, what transpires today translates into the future well enough. Today's issue has been pretty heavy with talks of what society is unsure of. Hopefully I didn't scare anyone off with this talk, I just thought it was important enough to clarify something I've heard talked about quite a bit recently.</p>
            <p>You'll notice some sections are missing from today's issue. That's because I don't want to leave a ton of blank space in the periodical. I'm not discontinuing them, I'm just hiding them until I have something to put in those sections. That said, keep your eyes peeled for them again! The reader count for this periodical is growing.</p>
